INSERT INTO `Illnesses` (`description`,`date_created`,`last_updated`) VALUES ('Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C.[1] Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, and sore arms and legs.[1][2] Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, changes to hair, and bleeding from the skin may occur.[1][3] As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.[2]
Typically, scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet.[1] It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur.[1][2] In modern times, it occurs most commonly in people with mental disorders, unusual eating habits, alcoholism, and old people who live alone.[2] Other risk factors include intestinal malabsorption and dialysis.[2] Humans and certain other animals require vitamin C in their diets to make the building blocks for collagen.[2] Diagnosis typically is based on physical signs, X-rays, and improvement after treatment.[2]
Treatment is with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth.[1] Improvement often begins in a few days with complete recovery in a few weeks.[2] Sources of vitamin C in the diet include citrus fruit and a number of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes.[2] Cooking often decreases vitamin C in foods.[2]
Scurvy currently is rare.[2] It occurs more often in the developing world in association with malnutrition.[2] Rates among refugees are reported at 5% to 45%.[4] Scurvy was described as early as the time of ancient Egypt.[2] It was a limiting factor in long distance sea travel, often killing large numbers of people.[5] A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, was the first to prove it could be treated with citrus fruit in a 1753 publication.[2][6] His experiments represented the first controlled trial.[7] It took another 40 years before the British Navy began giving out lemon juice routinely.','2012-12-22','2012-12-22');
