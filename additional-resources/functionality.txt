#search
1. search local area (search radius) by illness
2. search local area (search radius) by recipe
3. search local area (search radius) by plant
4. search local area (search radius) by user reports
	*if i know a fellow user, i want to be able to search for their uploads
6. view map of all plant_locations given start location and radius

#social
*make user groups for sharing local info


#planning
*plan an outing
	-options for academic settings
	-options for lay people

#contributing to database
*upload plant_location
	maybe have it be that a user must supply the following:
		a photograph OR	a name (common or latin)
		a location (coordinate)
		++whether the land is public -- any way to have google assign this rather than let user do it?
		whether the location is on their propery
			if so, whether they leave it open to foraging by other users
			make option for private/group sharing
				^^how to handle this situation? see private/group sharing below....		
		
		
	optional 	

		
	-what is nullable?
*vote in IDs
	different users have different levels of expertise -- could show both
	people can vote on which plant a picture shows
	shows search user those stats so they can judge for themselves whether to trust


#private/group sharing
	note: if a user only wants plant_locations on their property to be viewable by selected other users, should give an 			option

#side notes
this would be similar to the geochaching websites
