uncertainties
-------------


1. in db
	*how should the variety of "people" interacting with website be treated?
		-
	*how should i indicate that a plant_illness can have many instructions for use
	*how do i deal with dates? what's worth having in there?
	*how do i link more than one piece of research to a plant_illness
	*is it worth it to make a Location_PropertyOwner bridge table? what advantage would it confer? disadvantage?
	*how are the relationships btw User Photographer PropertyOwner etc modeled as DTOs?
	*is it necessary to split these up so much? could I just have a single user table with several fields?
	*if i want users to be able to upload photos of themselves, should that be in a different table?
	*if an Authority table exists in db, does it also exist as dto?
	*does it make sense to use inheritance for users? abstract user class that photographer, admin, etc inherit from?
	

2. in front end
3. in java
4. in functionality
	*what's worth pursuing?
		-research function
		-school/field trip function
		-
it's ok. just write down whatever ideas you have and then maybe you can implement them later
